Prose can also be considered a full-featured writing environment. It's like your desktop text editor but your articles are stored on Github, complete with a revision history. Also you can share beautiful versions of your documents online. Five steps to your new writing desk.

1. Create a Github account if you don't have one.
2. Create a repository called `documents`.
3. Open [Prose](http://prose.io) and navigate to the `documents` repository.
4. Create an [article](http://prose.github.com/prose/#prose/prose/gh-pages/_posts/about/2012-06-14-about.md/edit).
5. [Share](http://prose.github.com/prose/#prose/prose/gh-pages/_posts/about/2012-06-14-about.md) it.
