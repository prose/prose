# Introducing Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io) is a web-based interface for managing text-based content in your GitHub repositories. Use it to create, edit, and delete files, and save your changes directly to GitHub.

Prose is great for making quick updates to your code or managing your blog. It pays special attention to [Jekyll sites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) [hosted on GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) with Markdown text preview and syntax reference. It's [configurable](help/handbook.html#set_root_url) to restrict users to files that live within the `_posts` directory so you can use it to manage the content on your blog without fear of changing other critical files. Using Jekyll in conjunction with Prose is a smart way of maintaining websites for developers and editors alike by allowing them to use a visual, web-based tool to manage the content.

[Get started now](/help/getting-started.html) or learn more about [using Jekyll to design flexible static websites](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/).

Navigate to [Prose.io](http://prose.io). Now you can sign in to [GitHub](http://github.com) by using OAuth.

## Browse Repositories

The landing page gives you all the repositories you have access to. If a Jekyll site has multiple branches, you are prompted to select your desired branch, otherwise you jump into the repo directly.

## Browsing Posts

Once you have selected a repository, you can browse your posts and sub-folders in a traditional file-browser-ish manner. You can create new files as well, which immediately opens an empty document for you, which you can save after populating it with some text.

## Edit Posts

Once the file has been loaded, all you have to do is pointing your cursor to the text and start typing. We're providing basic syntax highlighting for Markdown to assist you during the writing process.

## Preview

You can instantly preview your writing by either clicking the preview icon at the document menu bar, or `ctrl+shift+right` to toggle it.

## Cheatsheet

If you don't write on a daily basis (like me) you might have difficulties to remember the Markdown syntax so we also included a cheatsheet that you can use for reference. You reach it by pressing `ctrl+shift+left`.

## Publish

Once you are ready, you can easily publish your article, which lets it show up on the actual webpage/blog. Try it.

## Metadata

Take full control about your post, and edit Metadata aka the YAML frontmatter. No limitations.

# Not only for Jekyll

The editor not only supports Jekyll websites but can be used to edit any github repository (respectively any contained text file). You can use it to edit `server.js` of your Node.js application for instance. 

However, if you navigate to a Jekyll repository, the editor is smart enough to recognize that and provides a the metadata editor along with the markdown preview panel.


# Suitable for writers

Prose is also suitable as a full-featured writing environment, covering authoring and sharing articles. That's how you can do it:

1. Create a new GitHub repository and call it say `documents`.
2. Open the editor and create `hello-world.md`.
3. Save it.
4. Share it (we support deep linking to the rendered version)

Prose is similiar to [iAWriter](http://www.iawriter.com/) as it is also using a minimal interface for editing Markdown, but it's web-based and uses [GitHub](http://github.com) for storing your text so your writings are more than safe and GitHub keeps a history of every saved version. Prose can potentially be seen as a new way of sharing documents online, while utilizing the usual suspects Markdown and GitHub.


# Internals

Internally, Prose is just a static webpage and doesn't require any server-side bits. Instead it interacts directly with the GitHub API for managing your repo's contents. This means there's nothing to setup, no database no fileserver etc. This is imporant because we want to make it easy for you to get involved in the development.

Using just the GitHub API for powering our editor was not easy. GitHub just offers a low level API (around trees and blobs), which is challening in many cases, as it requires a lot of subsequent requests to do simple things, and also effects performance. That's why creating a good architecture was crucial to manage the complexity. We ended up in abstracting the data layer into a separate module, Github.js.

## Github.js

[Github.js](https://github.com/michael/github) is a higher-level wrapper around the GitHub API. It's intended for exactly our use case, namely interacting with GitHub from the browser. It supports reading, writing, renaming and deleting files. Goal was to have a simple data abstraction layer, nothing to fancy, but providing exactly the operations we need.


## Gatekeeper

Because of some [security-related limitations](http://blog.vjeux.com/2012/javascript/github-oauth-login-browser-side.html), GitHub prevents you from implementing the OAuth Web Application Flow on a client-side only application.

This is a real bummer. So we built [Gatekeeper](http://github.com/developmentseed/gatekeeper), which is the missing piece you need in order to make OAuth work.


# Future plans

This is a first release dedicated to developers at this early stage. It will be buggy as we work out the kinks, but we plan to make this rock solid and extend the feature set (while keeping the UI as minimal as possible). We hope Prose + Jekyll will provide a simple, efficient alternative to traditional CMSs that require web and database servers to host content.


## Get involved

Prose is 100% open source. We'd like to encourage you to contribute and help us improve this application to make website development and maintainance easier. Start contributing by filing tickets on GitHub or touch the [codebase](http://github.com/prose).
