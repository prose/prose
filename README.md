# Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io) is a web-based interface for managing text-based
content in your GitHub repositories. Use it to create, edit, and delete files,
and save your changes directly to GitHub.

It's designed to make it easy to managing a blog hosted on GutHub. It works
great on [sites built using Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
that are [hosted on GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

## Using prose for your next project

Prose supports configuration settings with a variety of options making it easy
to adjust the application to support your needs on a project. You can see a
list of
[options on the wiki page](https://github.com/prose/prose/wiki/Configuration).
