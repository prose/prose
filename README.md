# Prose

Prose provides a beatifully simple content authoring environment for [CMS-free websites](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/). It's a web-based interface for managing content on [GitHub](http://github.com). Use it to create, edit, and delete files, and save your changes directly to GitHub. Host your website on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) for free, or set up your own [GitHub webhook server](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/05/01/introducing-jekyll-hook/).
