# About

Prose provides a beautifully simple content authoring environment for [CMS-free websites](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/). It's a web-based interface for managing content on [GitHub](http://github.com). Use it to create, edit, and delete files, and save your changes directly to GitHub. Host your website on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) for free, or set up your own [GitHub webhook server](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/05/01/introducing-jekyll-hook/).

Prose has advanced support for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) sites and [markdown content](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Prose detects markdown posts in Jekyll sites and provides syntax highlighting, a formatting toolbar, and draft previews in the site's full layout.

Developers can configure Jekyll sites to take advantage of these and many more features that customize the content editing experience.

## Configuring

Prose can be configured per repository with additional metadata in a Jekyll site's `_config.yml` file or a separate `prose.yml` file. We offer Prose.io as a hosted service for the latest version, or you can download the source code and host it on your own. For developer documentation, see [the wiki page on GitHub](https://github.com/prose/prose/wiki).

Prose is an open source project. We encourage you to contribute and help us improve this application or adapt it to your needs. For instructions on developing Prose, see the [Prose contributing guidelines](https://github.com/prose/prose/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We do not offer support for Prose at this time, however if you are a content editor using Prose, you should contact the developer who gave you access to it. To report technical problems with Prose, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/prose/prose/issues).
